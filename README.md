Java Programming – Assignment 02
B.Tech – Semester 3
📌 Project Overview

This project is a menu-driven Calculator Application implemented in Java to demonstrate Method Overloading.
Users can perform basic arithmetic operations using different overloaded versions of methods such as:

add(int, int)

add(double, double)

add(int, int, int)

subtract(int, int)

multiply(double, double)

divide(int, int) (with divide-by-zero handling)

The project includes a simple CLI-based interface to accept user inputs and display results.

🎯 Assignment Objectives
